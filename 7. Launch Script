Alright, listen up. If you want to run an Aztec Network Sequencer Node on your VPS to position yourself for rewards and the potential airdrop, here is the technical breakdown in English.

Aztec is a privacy-preserving ZK-Rollup. Running a sequencer means you are responsible for ordering transactions and building blocks.

1. Hardware Requirements (VPS Specs)
Don't use a cheap shared instance. Generating ZK proofs requires dedicated resources.

CPU: 8 Cores (Modern architecture).

RAM: 16GB - 32GB (The more, the better for proof generation).

Storage: 200GB+ NVMe SSD.

Network: 1Gbps unmetered.

2. System Preparation
Update your Ubuntu 22.04/24.04 LTS and install the necessary dependencies.

Bash

sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install curl git jq build-essential -y
3. Install Docker & Docker Compose
Aztec's stack is containerized. Ensure you have the latest version.

Bash

# Install Docker
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
sudo sh get-docker.sh

# Install Docker Compose
sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/latest/download/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
4. Obtain L1 RPC Endpoints (Sepolia)
Aztec needs to sync with Ethereum.

Execution Client: Use Alchemy or Infura (Sepolia).

Consensus Client: Use a Beacon node provider (QuickNode or your own).

Note: Your RPCs must be stable; otherwise, your node will desync and miss rewards.

5. Configuration (Environment Variables)
Create a directory and the configuration file.

Bash

mkdir -p ~/aztec-sequencer/data && cd ~/aztec-sequencer
nano .env
Paste the following (replace placeholders):

Fragmento de código

ETHEREUM_HOST=https://eth-sepolia.g.alchemy.com/v2/YOUR_API_KEY
L1_CONSENSUS_HOST_URL=https://your-beacon-node-url.com
# Your private key for staking (must have Sepolia ETH)
VALIDATOR_PRIVATE_KEY=0xYOUR_PRIVATE_KEY
# Address where rewards will be sent
COINBASE=0xYOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS
LOG_LEVEL=info
P2P_PORT=40400
6. Create the Deployment File
Create the docker-compose.yml:

YAML

version: '3.8'
services:
  aztec-node:
    image: "aztecprotocol/aztec:latest"
    container_name: "aztec-node"
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
      - "40400:40400"
    volumes:
      - ./data:/var/lib/data
    env_file: .env
    entrypoint: >-
      node --no-warnings /usr/src/yarn-project/aztec/dest/bin/index.js start --node --archiver --sequencer --network testnet
    restart: always
